Get's Peloton workout data into Strava

Currently, when running `npm test` and with a Peloton login and password in environment vars or a `.env` file, a TCX file that can be uploaded into Strava with all the ride metrics is created.

Future plan is to make this easier to run and to upload to Strava with their API instead of requiring the manual upload step.
